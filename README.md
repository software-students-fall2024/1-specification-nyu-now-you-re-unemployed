6) As an app user, I want a more efficient alternative in navigation so that I do not have to use a physical map
7) As a person who lives in a different borough, I want to navigate the subway system so that I know how to quickly travel to Manhattan
8) As a person who struggles with walking long distances, I want to find the closest subway stations so that I can minimize the amount I have to commute by foot
9) As a user who is visiting NYC during the winter, I want to learn how to use the subway system so that I can avoid walking in harsh winter weather whenever possible
10) As a user who relies on traveling between boroughs daily, I want to view real time updates of the subway so that I can plan ahead for delays or cancellations
